This is a final project that is a website about buying a house

The home page is a welcome/home page.
The index file is a budget calculator for buying your house.
The amenities page allows you to select your preferred lot, which it adds or removes from an array, and you can see it in the console.
The email on the amenities page, directs to another page, results, and stores the email in a cookie.
The elapsed time calculator calculates the time elapsed from an inputted date vs today. 
The website security page was a specific assignment for class and uses your IP address to display your lat/long or altitude if you're on mobile. The Google Maps page doesn't properly display because it requires an API key from Google to proceed with displaying your location.
